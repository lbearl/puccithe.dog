# puccithe.dog
A flask application + bash shell script which operates as a very basic puppy cam. It runs on a raspberry pi 1 (2011 model)

## Introduction
This application was created to let me play with running a web application on a Raspberry Pi that I purchased a few years ago that 
was just sitting on a self collecting dust. Pucci, my dog, spends a lot of time sitting at home, and I figured it would be interesting to
see what he is up to all day. I also wanted to play around with a few other things (like Namecheap's Dynamic DNS offering).

## More Information
I have a full writeup of the justification of this project and some technical details related to its current deployment in my apartment on
my [blog](https://www.lukebearl.com/2016/04/25/pucci-the-dog-flask-rpi).
